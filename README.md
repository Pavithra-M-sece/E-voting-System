# 🗳️ E-Voting System (Phase I – Console)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **E-Voting System** is a Java-based console application that simulates a simple digital voting process.  
It allows **voter registration, candidate listing, vote casting, and result viewing** — all within a text-based interface.  
This project demonstrates **core Java concepts** like **OOP, Collections, and basic Exception Handling**.

## 🏗️ Class Design (OOP)
- **Voter** → `voterId`, `name`, `hasVoted`  
- **Candidate** → `candidateId`, `name`, `voteCount`  
- **E-Voting System (Main)** → Manages voters, candidates, and voting process using **ArrayList** and **HashMap**.
